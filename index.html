      <h2>Why Relationships Matter More Than We Think</h2>
      <p>As teenagers, we‚Äôre figuring out who we are, who we want to be, and who we want to share our lives with, whether that‚Äôs our best friends, our families, or a romantic partner. Relationships shape our identity. They teach us about trust, loyalty, patience, and sacrifice.
But in a world that often confuses love with lust and connection with attention, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in the noise. The truth is, we were created for deep, lasting, life-giving love. That‚Äôs the kind of love God wants for us‚Äîa love that mirrors His own: selfless, faithful, and true.

    <section id="sexuality">
      <h2>Teen Sexuality Today: The Facts You Don‚Äôt Always Hear</h2>
      <p>According to a 2022 report by Statistics Canada, around 24% of teens between the ages of 15 and 19 have had sexual intercourse. Many of those teens say they felt pressured, unprepared, or unsure. At the same time, the number of teens affected by STIs has increased, and many admit they didn't fully understand the emotional impact of becoming sexually active.
Social media, music, and shows often portray sex as casual and consequence-free‚Äîbut that‚Äôs not the full picture. There‚Äôs a gap between what‚Äôs portrayed and what teens really experience. The more we learn, the more we realize how important it is to approach sexuality with care, wisdom, and purpose.

    <section id="pressure">
      <h2>Peer Pressure, Pop Culture, and the Push to Fit In</h2>
      <p>‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs doing it.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so old-fashioned.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWhy wait?‚Äù
These are just a few of the phrases teens hear when they choose to live differently. Whether it‚Äôs direct peer pressure or the silent influence of TikTok trends and celebrity relationships, the message is loud: if you‚Äôre not sexually active, you‚Äôre missing out.
But here‚Äôs the truth: choosing chastity isn‚Äôt about missing out. It‚Äôs about saying yes to love that‚Äôs authentic and lasting. It‚Äôs about setting your own boundaries instead of letting others define them for you. Living chastely takes courage, but it also brings peace, clarity, and a stronger sense of self-worth.

    <section id="intimacy">
      <h2>What the Church Really Teaches About Sex and Intimacy</h2>
      <p>Contrary to what some might believe, the Catholic Church doesn‚Äôt see sex as something bad or shameful. In fact, it sees sex as something beautiful‚Äîa sacred gift from God that expresses the total giving of oneself to another within marriage.
According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sexual intimacy is meant to unite a husband and wife and open their hearts to the gift of life. It‚Äôs more than a physical act‚Äîit‚Äôs a powerful, spiritual sign of love and trust.
Outside of marriage, sex becomes disconnected from that full purpose. The Church teaches that we are called to treat sex not casually, but with reverence and responsibility. It‚Äôs not about restriction‚Äîit‚Äôs about making sure that our actions reflect our deepest values.

    <section id="freedom">
      <h2>Chastity: A Path of Freedom, Not Fear</h2>
      <p>Chastity is often misunderstood. People think it just means saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to sex‚Äîbut it‚Äôs so much more than that. Chastity is about living in a way that honors your dignity and the dignity of others. It‚Äôs about love that‚Äôs patient, respectful, and real.
God‚Äôs moral laws about sex aren‚Äôt there to trap us‚Äîthey‚Äôre there to protect us. Like any good parent, God sets boundaries because He loves us. When we live chastely, we‚Äôre not denying love‚Äîwe‚Äôre preparing for the fullness of it. Chastity helps us love like Christ: selflessly, purely, and freely.

    <section id="message">
      <h2>From One Teen to Another: You‚Äôre Not Alone</h2>
      <p>You don‚Äôt have to give in to pressure. You don‚Äôt have to compromise your values. And you‚Äôre definitely not alone in choosing a different path. Choosing chastity doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre behind‚Äîit means you‚Äôre strong, wise, and thinking about the kind of love you truly deserve.
One day, you‚Äôll be so glad you waited. Real love is never rushed, and your heart is too valuable to be handled casually. So hold your head high. You‚Äôre choosing something powerful‚Äîand you‚Äôre never walking that road alone.
